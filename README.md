When using AWS Lambda, one challenge I faced was making sure the function handled the request data correctly for both POST and GET methods. It took some practice to understand how the input event from API Gateway was structured. With DynamoDB, the main challenge was adjusting to a NoSQL database, especially designing the table with the right key and learning how to use the basic CRUD operations.

From this project, I learned how Lambda and DynamoDB work together to create a serverless application. I now understand how to connect an API Gateway to a Lambda function, and how that function can store and retrieve data in DynamoDB. This experience helped me see how serverless applications can be simple to set up and useful for building scalable web apps.
